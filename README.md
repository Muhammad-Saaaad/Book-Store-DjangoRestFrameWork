# **Book Store API**
  This project is a feature-rich API for managing a virtual book store with three types of users: Admin, Buyer, and Seller. The API includes functionalities for user registration, login, shop creation, book management, and secure payment processing using Stripe. Below is a breakdown of the user roles and their capabilities.

## **User Roles and Functionalities**

### **1. Admin**

  The admin has a comprehensive view of all users registered on the platform.
  Admin privileges are limited to user management.

### **2. Buyer**

  Buyers are the primary customers of the book store. They have the following capabilities:

**View Shops and Books:**

  A buyer can browse all available shops.
  They can view the list of books in any selected shop.

**Purchase Books:**

  Buyers can choose a book by its ID and add it to their purchase record, linked with their user ID.

**Stripe Payment Integration:**

  Stripe is used for secure payment processing.
  Webhooks, such as payment_intent.successful, are integrated for handling payment confirmation events.
  Buyers who have already purchased a book won't see the checkout page again when re-calling the payment API.

**ðŸ›‘ Note: Only buyers are authorized to make payments.**

### **3. Seller**

  Sellers are responsible for managing shops and books. They can:

**Add and Manage Shops:**

  Sellers can create multiple shops and manage their information.

**Add and Manage Books:**

  Sellers can add books to their shops and update them as needed.
  
**View Own Shops:**

  Sellers have access to all their shops and the associated information.

### **Authentication**
  This API uses JWT Authentication to ensure secure access.

**Registered Users Only:**

  Users must register and log in to gain access to the API.
  Without authentication, users are restricted from using any endpoints.

### **Technologies Used**
  **Payment Integration:** Stripe for handling payments and webhooks.
  **Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure access.

**How to Use**

Register as a user.
Log in using your credentials to obtain a JWT token.
