# **Book Store API**
  This project is a feature-rich API for managing a virtual bookstore with three types of users: Admin, Buyer, and Seller. The API includes functionalities for user registration, login, shop creation, book management, and secure payment processing using Stripe. Below is a breakdown of the user roles and their capabilities.

## **User Roles and Functionalities**

### **1. Admin**

  The admin has a comprehensive view of all users registered on the platform.
  Admin privileges are limited to user management.

### **2. Buyer**

  Buyers are the primary customers of the bookstore. They have the following capabilities:

**View Shops and Books:**

  A buyer can browse all available shops.
  They can view the list of books in any selected shop.

**Purchase Books:**

  Buyers can choose a book by its ID and add it to their purchase record, linked with their user ID.

**Stripe Payment Integration:**

  Stripe is used for secure payment processing.
  Webhooks, such as payment_intent.successful, are integrated for handling payment confirmation events.
  Buyers who have already purchased a book won't see the checkout page again when re-calling the payment API.

**ðŸ›‘ Note: Only buyers are authorized to make payments.**

**Add and Manage Shops:**
